# OnTop
Simple Winapi C app for setting a window to be always on top. 

This is a debug build with simple build script included. Just run build.bat to compile the 64 bit version of the program using MSVC. This can be changed to 32 bit by changing to 'bversion' variable in the build script to x32 instead of x64. Ensure the vcvarsallPath variable points to your MSVC directory where vcvarsall.bat is stored. 


SHIFT+CLICK to set a window always on top, 
CTRL+CLICK to remove on top status, 
F12 to quit
